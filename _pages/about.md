I am Teng Shi, a third-year Ph.D. student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, advised by [Professor Jun Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=su14mcEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Professor Xiao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5FZ6wbAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
My research interests lie in recommender systems, information retrieval, and large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the joint modeling of search and recommendation. I am broadly interested in building intelligent systems that understand user intent and provide personalized, context-aware information access.
